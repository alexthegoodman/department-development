# navigation react native
[https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) built on top of [https://github.com/wix/react-native-controllers](https://github.com/wix/react-native-controllers) does integrate with Redux also.

_Itâ€™s official. The react-router, react-redux, react-router-redux, react-router-native combo-fiasco is over. Of those 4 inter-connected items, there are many hard-to-find version incompatibilities. Just a terrible solution on Native._

Need a new solution which also has support for gestures and various transitions. See RN Navigation and RN Controllers.
