# mamp remote port local site testing
This is for loading a site on local wifi network with Mamp PRO.

IP address: 10.230.223.93 or 10.0.0.108 (Bernie network) found in System Preferences>Network

Then 10.0.0.108:1234 corresponds to specific hostname, make sure to set the hostname’s Port. The Port is required if it’s set.

Fonts, images, and other local files may need to be re-set in order to load, but CSS, JS will load correctly.
