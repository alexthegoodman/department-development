# React vs Angular
React can be messy. Angular provides structure and cohesive work.

The decision between these frameworks is objective and non-partisan. React is developed by Facebook, while Angular is developed my Google.

* Overview
	* React is considered lightweight, performant, and is intended to integrate with many community tools. (Including other Facebook products like Flux and Relay)
	* Angular is heavier, with a longer learning curve, but has many needed tools baked in.
	* Both are 100% capable of meeting the requirements set forth to today’s SPAs and PWAs.
* Angular
	* Pros
		* TypeScript (and RxJS) are needed, which adds slight overhead, but is considered to lead to few bugs / technical debt
		* Familiar MVC architecture
		* Considered suitable for more complex business logic
	* Cons
		* Relatively slow
		* More popular back in 2012, when Backbone and Ember had market share
* React
	* Pros
		* High-performance and high flexibility
		* Higher demand in the market
		* Considered more stable (fewer breaking changes with new updates) with a larger community
	* Cons
		* Integrating 3rd party tools can lead to its own overhead
		* More manual processing

Alex’s view:
* Would absolutely love a deep dive into Angular 4 and Typescript
* Could also implement a reliable system on React 16 / React Fiber
