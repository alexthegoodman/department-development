	* Skype does not have best Number selection, and has very poor SMS support
	* Second phone with minutes?
* Every open computer is a vulnerable touchpoint

Would love to consider bringing in outside consultants for this sorts of things, or at least being knowledgable so I can differentiate between on-site security, hosting security, and the larger IT / organization security, finally reaching your physical security.

However, this only overlaps a bit with our application security offerings.

This and  [[Infrastructure Security Plan]] may talk more about internal procedures for teams to be pro-active (changing passwords every 90 days with a password manager)

* Addresses mostly hosting and environment set-up, some policy items:

This is for those who need each step double verified, encrypted, and fire-walled.
	* Outside consultant could consider these proposals: Firewalls, a lightweight OS and Management system on a private server, regular testing and monitoring. Like on-page SEO and off-page, security is the same. But BN will probably not take this approach, except perhaps to Security Planning on a site. Should there be a Deliverable matching the Literature here? - will make a note of this in the correct spot
