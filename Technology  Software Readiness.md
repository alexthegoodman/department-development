	* Seem to describe the various stages of Technology Development, rather than a scale, measure, or concrete definition for Readiness

	* Seems smart - it considers the faults found already (failure rate) and uses that as the basis for **predictive model** which generates the likely number of coming faults and the time needed to solve them

	* Are your applications fit for purpose?
	* Are your environments fit for purpose?
	* Are your processes and tools fit for purpose?
	* Are your users trained and ready?
