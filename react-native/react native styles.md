# react native styles
do a gulp or a webpack, and do a -react-native-css -i ._css_style.css -o ._css_style.js â€”watch (sudo npm install react-native-css@1.2.55 -g for HS due to already-being-used SASS. Then add to package.json the script to run the local module as -g: [https://firstdoit.com/no-need-for-globals-using-npm-dependencies-in-npm-scripts-3dfb478908](https://firstdoit.com/no-need-for-globals-using-npm-dependencies-in-npm-scripts-3dfb478908) )-
 
 
For now: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-react-native-stylesheet-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-react-native-stylesheet-css) or [https://github.com/raphamorim/native-css](https://github.com/raphamorim/native-css)

Consider switch to: [https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components#react-native](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components#react-native) keeps styles separate as desired
