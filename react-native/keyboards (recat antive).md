Good to push fields out of way, not so good for most forms - not needed either. a scrollview or an auto-focusing view is better. <KeyboardAvoidingView behavior="position" keyboardVerticalOffset={-135} contentContainerStyle={[styles.formStep, { height: (height - 135) }]}>

done and arrow buttons not native, implementable from scratch.

KeyboardAwareScrollView is good except the Auto Scroll. Auto Scroll would be good if a fork were made that disabled positive Y values. The top input need not scroll to the middle when in focus, only inputs underneath the keyboard not to scroll into view via a negative Y. Besides that, itâ€™s nice.

The native Keyboard module is good for getting good animations and the like.
